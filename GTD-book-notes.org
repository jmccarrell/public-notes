** Chapter 7: Organizing

There are 7 main types of data I need to manage from an organizational and operational perspective:

1. A projects list
2. Project support materials
3. Calendar actions and information
4. Next actions list
5. a Waiting for list
6. Reference material
7. a Someday/Maybe list

*** Organizing NonActionable Data

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Interestingly, one of the biggest problems with most people's personal management system is that they blend a few actionable things with a large amount of data and material that has value but no action attached.

Having good, consistent structures with which to manage the nonactionable items in our work and lives is as important as managing our action and project reminders.

The 3 categories of non-actionable items:

1. Reference materials
2. Reminders of things that need no action now, but might at a later date
3. Trash

The value of Someday/Maybe disappears if you don't put your conscious awareness back onto it with some consistency.
