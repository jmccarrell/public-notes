mysql notes on bit functions.
We have:

bit_and
bit_count
bit_length
bit_or
bit_xor

default()       return the default value for a column.

so if the default value sets every bit, then we can write expressions that compute
if every bit is set in a generic way.

<=>             null-safe equal to operator

export_set()    Return a string such that for every bit set in the value bits, you get an on
                string and for every unset bit, you get an off string

field()
find_in_set()   Return the index position of the first argument within the second argument

make_set()

group_concat()  what does this do?
name_const()    internal function
