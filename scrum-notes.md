- it is often useful to identify *who*, *what* and *why* in a product backlog item

- definition of Done
    - [blog about this](http://blogs.collab.net/agile/suggested-topics-for-definition-of-done-discussion)

- some possible definitions of done:
    - DONE: properly tested, refactored, potentially shippable
    - what defn of done will help avoid technical debt?
    - DONE:
        - all previous regression tests pass
        - regression tests for new functionality run automatically with every build
        - code has been written by pairs, or at least reviewed both other team members
        - duplicate code has been removed by refactoring
        - messy and poorly designed code has been cleaned up, through refactoring
        - manual, exploratory testing has been conducted
        - checkout and builds are fully reproducible, typically with one or two commands

- back log refinement meeting purpose:

1. help the product owner get the top of the backlog ready for the next sprint planning meeting
1. estimation of effort
1. clarification of requirements
1. decomposition of large PRIs into smaller ones; often epics into user stories
