For what it’s worth, I’m all keyboard in this workflow. That helps prevent the “Stop-Find Password-Paste-Continue” flow issue of grabbing the mouse/trackpad.

1. Do whatever it is you do to make a password prompt appear.
1. Press ⌘+Opt+\
1. (Possibly enter master password at this point.)
1. Start typing the login you’re looking for.
1. Use the arrow keys to highlight the password dots field, press Enter.

You’re back to the password prompt where you can now ⌘+V. The other nice thing I like is that 1Password will automatically clear your clipboard of the password in 90 seconds. (Default setting, configurable.)
