proteus-> brew info mysql
mysql 5.1.48
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/
Depends on: readline
Not installed

Set up databases with:
    mysql_install_db

If this is your first install, automatically load on login with:
    cp /usr/local/Cellar/mysql/5.1.48/com.mysql.mysqld.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents
    launchctl load -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.mysql.mysqld.plist

If this is an upgrade and you already have the com.mysql.mysqld.plist loaded: 
    launchctl unload -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.mysql.mysqld.plist
    cp /usr/local/Cellar/mysql/5.1.48/com.mysql.mysqld.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents
    launchctl load -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.mysql.mysqld.plist

Note on upgrading: 
    We overwrite any existing com.mysql.mysqld.plist in ~/Library/LaunchAgents 
    if we are upgrading because previous versions of this brew created the 
    plist with a version specific program argument.

Or start manually with:
    /usr/local/Cellar/mysql/5.1.48/share/mysql/mysql.server start

proteus-> mysql_install_db
WARNING: The host 'usca1mc-27typ4' could not be looked up with resolveip.
This probably means that your libc libraries are not 100 % compatible
with this binary MySQL version. The MySQL daemon, mysqld, should work
normally with the exception that host name resolving will not work.
This means that you should use IP addresses instead of hostnames
when specifying MySQL privileges !
Installing MySQL system tables...
OK
Filling help tables...
OK

To start mysqld at boot time you have to copy
support-files/mysql.server to the right place for your system

PLEASE REMEMBER TO SET A PASSWORD FOR THE MySQL root USER !
To do so, start the server, then issue the following commands:

/usr/local/Cellar/mysql/5.1.48/bin/mysqladmin -u root password 'new-password'
/usr/local/Cellar/mysql/5.1.48/bin/mysqladmin -u root -h usca1mc-27typ4 password 'new-password'

Alternatively you can run:
/usr/local/Cellar/mysql/5.1.48/bin/mysql_secure_installation

which will also give you the option of removing the test
databases and anonymous user created by default.  This is
strongly recommended for production servers.

See the manual for more instructions.

You can start the MySQL daemon with:
cd /usr/local/Cellar/mysql/5.1.48 ; /usr/local/Cellar/mysql/5.1.48/bin/mysqld_safe &

You can test the MySQL daemon with mysql-test-run.pl
cd /usr/local/Cellar/mysql/5.1.48/mysql-test ; perl mysql-test-run.pl

Please report any problems with the /usr/local/Cellar/mysql/5.1.48/bin/mysqlbug script!

----------------

shut down mysql:

mysqladmin -u root -p shutdown


----------------

I choose a mysql root password to:

javaone10

Next I made a jmccarre user

mysql> select PASSWORD('javaone10');
+-------------------------------------------+
| PASSWORD('javaone10')                     |
+-------------------------------------------+
| *CEEFADCFAD25D86B2C2CC556E237720958C21A7C |
+-------------------------------------------+

CREATE USER 'jmccarre'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY '*CEEFADCFAD25D86B2C2CC556E237720958C21A7C';

----------------------------------------------------------------

Now create hte hearst db I want to use for the data mining challenge:

mysql> create database hearst;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)

and grant all privileges to user jmccarre

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `hearst`.* to 'jmccarre'@'localhost'

Now login to mysql as jmccarre

and set up the hearst tables, etc.
