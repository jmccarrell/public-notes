* Jeffs notes using chef and knife

Jason Rosendale said:

Today’s weird use of knife’s --command option:

I don’t remember all of the many command line options necessary to connect to the replica RDS instance. But I know that I did it once from one of the preprod boxes. So:
```knife deploy preprod reputedly-web-* --command='grep mysql  ~/.bash_history'
```
I’m not 100% sure why, but `--command='history'` doesn’t actually do anything

@jason.rosendale you could do a knife search to grab an ipaddress, then do an ssh for bash_history so
`knife search "chef_environment:staging AND roles:reputedly-web-*" -a ipaddress`
then
`knife ssh "chef_environment:staging AND ipaddress:1.2.3.4" "grep mysql ~/.bash_history"`
