If you use Chrome and 1Password constantly, you’ll want to know about these nifty keyboard shortcuts for getting around the Chrome extension quickly and painlessly:
⌘\ (Command-Backslash)— Logins for this site
⌥⌘\ (Option-Command-Backslash) — All Logins (Go & Fill)

The above keyboard shortcuts can be customized in the main 1Password application (Preferences > Logins). The rest of these are Chrome-only shortcuts for now.
⌘1 (Command-1) — select Logins tab
⌘2 (Command-2) — select Identities tab
⌘3 (Command-3) — select Credit Cards tab
⌘4 (Command-4) — select Password Generator tab
→ (Right Arrow) — show selected item details when in the list view
← (Left Arrow) — return back to the list view from the item details
Tab — switch between “Logins for this site” and “All Logins” on Logins tab
Enter or return — Fill and Submit the selected login (If you are browsing All Logins, the extension will Go, Fill, and Submit the selected login)

}

Ok, the usual login process at amazon offered to save my password as expected.
Try setting a strong amazon.com password.
