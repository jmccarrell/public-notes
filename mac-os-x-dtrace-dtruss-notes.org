** enabling dtrace OS X
how to overcome OS X System Integrity Protection to [[https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/208762/now-that-el-capitan-is-rootless-is-there-any-way-to-get-dtrace-working/208763#208763][enable dtrace]]

** learn dtrace by example
*** [[http://www.brendangregg.com/dtrace.html][Dtrace tools]]
the main site to explore and learn; from (one of?) the dtrace authors?
*** [[https://8thlight.com/blog/colin-jones/2015/11/06/dtrace-even-better-than-strace-for-osx.html][DTrace: {even better than} strace for OS X]]
just an Ok page, has some 'convert strace to dtrace' kind of stuff.
not that great.
*** [[https://8thlight.com/blog/colin-jones/2017/02/02/dtrace-gotchas-on-osx.html][A few DTrace gotchas and workarounds on OS X]]
shows the limitations of trying to run anything that uses anything from an apple system protected directory,
ie: /usr/bin/env

** dtrace results
Ok, I was able to enable drace; iotop worked for me.

#+begin_src sh
❯ csrutil status
System Integrity Protection status: enabled (Custom Configuration).

Configuration:
	Apple Internal: disabled
	Kext Signing: enabled
	Filesystem Protections: enabled
	Debugging Restrictions: enabled
	DTrace Restrictions: disabled
	NVRAM Protections: enabled
	BaseSystem Verification: enabled

This is an unsupported configuration, likely to break in the future and leave your machine in an unknown state.

** dtrace mysql client to find which .cnf files are loaded
the simplest case:

#+begin_src sh
❯ sudo dtruss mysql --login-path=local
#+end_src

which dumped out the below, which answered my questions.

#+begin_src sh
