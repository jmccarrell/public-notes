* How to delete a set of rows

recall that mysql cannot update or delete to a table named in a subquery

so you have to do the join, like this:

#+name: delete-long-191-rows
#+comment: against utf8
#+header: :engine mysql
#+header: :cmdline --login-path=utf8 entelo_production
#+begin_src sql
delete a1 from ats_imports a1
inner join
 (
  select id
    from ats_imports
   where length(work_email) > 191
 ) a_191
where a_191.id = a1.id
#+end_src
