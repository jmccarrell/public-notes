use bcrypt to encrypt my personal stuff.
  DONE build/install bcrypt from sources
  find a version of des to decrypt ~/etc/personal.tgz.des
    on negheb?
    or find an expanded copy of the tarball on neghe or atacama
  use bcrypt's compression
  dependencies
    bcrypt and tar
  generalize it to work on any passed in filename[s]
    how to handle pathnames with leading directories?
    where should the tree be expanded?
    how should it handle the compression phase?
      in general, we will have a directory full of stuff to encrypt
      idea: make the encrypt / decrypt operation explicit via command line switch
      idea: create name mappings between file extensions and the operations performed:
        .tar.bfe == decrypt iwth bcrypt; expand with tar
            .bfe == decrypt iwth bcrypt
      so if filename ends in one of those suffixes, it is a decrypt
      if the filename is a file, the result is filename.bfe
      if the path names a directory, the result is a directory hierarchy
  idea: invert the hierarchy
    instead of encrypting the tarball,
    walk the directory tree encrypting each file with the same key
    then tar up the result
    and encrypt that file
    advantages:
      we can use bcrypt's overwrite the file n times feature on each file
    disadvantages
      simply expanding the tarball gives the hierarchy of the file system
        answer: encrypt the tarball
  error conditions
    what should happen if there is an error half-way thru?
    idea: revert; keep a list of the directories and files already encrypted; uncrypt them
    idea: 2 pass
      first encrypt everything, then only if it succeeds once, do it again with removal turned on
      so first do it with -r; only if that succeeds; then do it with removal
  bcrypt interface
    Usage is: bcrypt -[orc][-sN] file1 file2..
      -o Write output to standard out
      -r Do NOT remove input files after processing
      -c Do NOT compress files before encryption
      -sN How many times to overwrite input files with random data
  FIXED bus error
    reproducible: bcrypt foo
    works:        bcrypt -o foo
    Need to compile bcrypt with -g; and debug the coredump 
    went away; so ignore it
    its back
    proteus-> bcrypt /tmp/filesync.pl 
    Encryption key:   (b*****************************)
    Again:
    Bus error    
    The issue is that if the source file is read-only, when the deletefile
      function tries to open it r+b (read/write), the fopen fails.
      before I hacked it, this case wasn't caught; hence bus-error.
      This is fixed in my copy of the source;
      now it will chmod() with user write if the fopen fails.
    Need to start backing up the source changes I am making
    email the author -- see if he wants the patch
  next I need to create an interface to pass in the encryption key
    first pass: pass on the command line (obviously insecure to ps, ...)
    
    ultimately: create a server listening on a unix domain socket
      pass the name of the socket to bcrypt
