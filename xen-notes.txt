A DomU guest is 3 things:
 -- a guest image that contains a set of files comprising a complete root filesystem
 -- a kernel; for paravirtualization, a modified kernel
 -- a config file

Store DomU guest configuration files in /etc/xen

Fedora / RHEL defaults to /var/lib/xen, not /xen/images for images

xm create first looks in . then in /etc/xen for xen config files

guest config files in /etc/xen/auto are started at system boot time
symlink there to the config files

start them up by hand with

/etc/init.d/xendomains start

xm shutdown -a
  shutdowns all DomUs
            -wa waits for the DomUs to shutdown
