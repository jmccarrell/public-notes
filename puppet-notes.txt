Make jeff-dev a puppet master
Make proteus a puppet slave

Install puppet on jeff-dev

jeff-dev-> sudo yum install ruby ruby-libs
  ...
Installed: ruby.x86_64 0:1.8.1-7.el4_6.1 ruby-libs.x86_64 0:1.8.1-7.el4_6.1
Complete!

Ensure the openssl and xmlrpc packages are installed as well:

jeff-dev-> ruby -ropenssl -e "puts :installed"
installed
jeff-dev-> ruby -rxmlrpc/client -e "puts :installed"
installed

they are.
However, this installs ruby 1.8.1 from 2003.
So we probably want something more recent, like the current stable release: 1.8.7

This link: HOWTO Install Fedora Ruby on RHEL
http://blogs.csuchico.edu/ik/2007/01/03/howto-install-fedora-ruby-on-rhel/
gives a recipe to compile and build ruby 1.8.5 from sources.
Should be easy to follow to build 1.8.7

Ensure RDoc is installed

jeff-dev-> ruby -rrdoc/usage -e "puts :installed"
ruby: No such file to load -- rdoc/usage (LoadError)

It is not.
Apparently ruby-rdoc is not in our yum repository either.

jeff-dev-> sudo yum install ruby-rdoc
  ...
No Match for argument: ruby-rdoc
Nothing to do

So I searched for docs; found ruby-docs and installed this, but the rdoc test still fails.
Giving up on this part.
My ruby book (more recent than the puppet book I was following) says ri is the doc tool.


Ensure facter is installed on jeff-dev.
There are rpms from reductive-labs.
facter is not in yum.
There are gems it can be installed from as well.

So how do I install a gem?

In ruby 1.9, gem is packaged with ruby.
For ruby 1.8, gem must be separately installed from http://rubygems.org

rubygems.org has a big list of files, but nothing that tells me which version
of gems goes with which version of ruby.
So that seems like a dead end.

However, the main puppet page contains a link to a separate yum repository
that contains a RHEL4 tree:

http://people.redhat.com/dlutter/yum/rhel4/

which contains the most recent stable puppet (0.24.4) and a facter 1.5.0,
which is apparently ahead of the stable facter (1.3.8)

It also contains augeas builds, which apparently is a redhat emerging techology:
http://augeas.net/
Augeas - a configuration API

Augeas is a configuration editing tool. It parses configuration files in their native formats and transforms them into a tree. Configuration changes are made by manipulating this tree and saving it back into native config files.
Augeas is:

    * An API provided by a C library
    * A command line tool to manipulate configuration from the shell (and shell scripts)
    * Language bindings to do the same from your favorite scripting language
    * Canonical tree representations of common configuration files
    * A domain-specific language to describe configuration file formats

Augeas goals:

    * Manipulate configuration files safely, safer than the ad-hoc techniques generally used with grep, sed, awk and similar mechanisms in scripting languages
    * Provide a local configuration API for Linux
    * Make it easy to integrate new config files into the Augeas tree

Ok, the other source for puppet for RHEL4 is EPEL:
http://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/epel/4/x86_64/repoview/puppet.html

Facter is here:
http://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/epel/4/x86_64/repoview/facter.html

Created ticket XXX for Wayne to take this further.

According to ruby-lang.org, the latest stable ruby version is 1.8.7

Following the ruby-lang.org links for OS X leads to
http://www.macruby.org/trac/wiki/MacRuby
which is an Apple-sponsored page.

http://www.macruby.org/trac/wiki/WhyMacRuby
tells what it is about; which is performance.
Looks like this is what we want to use on OS X.
