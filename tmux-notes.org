#+TITLE: Tmux Notes

* References

the [[https://danielmiessler.com/study/tmux/][tmux tutorial]] I used.  the [[https://danielmiessler.com/study/tmux/#reference][shortcut key references]] there are useful.

* Jeffs customizations

- I re-bind the default ~C-b~ to ~C-q~, so everywhere I have my dotiles, PREFIX is ~C-q~

* session management

- think of sessions as a top-level thing, like
    - leafcutter
    - api work

- from the server that you will be re-connecting to:
- start a tmux session, with a name

        $ tmux new -s session-name

- suspend a session inside it

        C-q d

- list sessions inside tmux

        C-q s

- how to see what is running after ssh

        $ [buildbot@buildbot ~]$ tmux list-clients
        /dev/pts/2: 1 [101x48 xterm-256color] (utf8)

- list active sessions at command line

        [buildbot@buildbot ~]$ tmux list-sessions
        1: 1 windows (created Tue Jun  2 23:38:39 2015) [101x47] (attached)
        bb: 1 windows (created Tue Jun  2 23:46:49 2015) [101x47]

- reattach

        $ tmux a -t session-name

- kill a session

        $ tmux kill-session -t session-name

* tmux and ssh together notes

[[http://www.bsdnow.tv/tutorials/ssh-tmux][combining ssh and tmux]]: no useful info here at all.

* other tmux configs to follow

- this [search: tmux ssh tutorial](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=tmux+ssh+tutorial&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8) shows interesting things to follow

- [maximum-awesome](https://github.com/square/maximum-awesome)
    - looks like some useful tmux goodness there
- more [tmux hints here](https://github.com/adnichols/tmux-and-vim#tmux)
- advice on how to [autostart tmux](http://marklodato.github.io/2013/10/31/autostart-tmux-on-ssh.html)


* jeff key bindings

- remap C-b to C-q

* My initial tmux.conf file

        # use C-q, as the prefix
        set-option -g prefix C-q
        unbind-key C-q
        bind-key C-q send-prefix
        set -g base-index 1

        # Easy config reload
        bind-key R source-file ~/.tmux.conf \; display-message "tmux.conf reloaded."

* window work

** split windows

- split window horizontally:  ~C-q "~
    - like ~C-x 4 b~ in emacs
    - bind-key          " split-window

- split window vertically:   ~C-q %~
    - Split the current pane into two, left and right.
    - like ~C-x 3 b~ in emacs
    - bind-key          % split-window -h

**  restore to a single pane

- break-pane  ~C-q !~
    - Break the current pane out of the window.
    - sort of like ~C-x 1~ in emacs, but splits the pane out into a new window like ~C-x 5~

- next layout:  ~C-q space~
    - bind-key      Space next-layout
    - cycles through some interesting window layouts; seems useful

* windows and panes

- there are both windows and panes

... Each session has one or more windows linked into it.  Windows may be linked to multiple sessions and are made up of one or more panes, each of which contains a pseudo terminal.

... the current pane may be changed with the select-pane command and the rotate-window and swap-pane commands may be used to swap panes without changing their position.  Panes are numbered beginning from zero in the order they are created.

** FAQ window operations

*** How do I see the current window and pane in the status bar?

    - A: ~C-q i~: display some info

           i           Display some information about the current window.

*** how do I switch between windows?
    - A: prev / next windows:

           l           Move to the previously selected window.
           n           Change to the next window.
           p           Change to the previous window.

    - is l and p the same thing?  I guess not

*** how do I switch between panes in a window?
    - A: ~C-q o~

           o           Select the next pane in the current window.

***  how do I make a new pane?
    - A: split an existing one, either:
        - into top and bottom (preferred): ~C-q "~
        - into left and right: ~C-q %~

*** how do I label/rename a session?
  - A: inside the session, use PREFIX $
  - or when you create the session, name it then
    - ~tmux new-session -s'jeff-notes'~

- Do any of my tutorials listed about talk about the copy buffer and how to use it?

* Tmux iterm2 integration -CC

- with tmux 2.9+, we now have [tmux integration](https://gitlab.com/gnachman/iterm2/wikis/TmuxIntegration)
    - This moves tmux commands out to the iterm2 level, which means a lot of nice integration features I want
    - use ~tmux -CC~

* More tmux usage to follow

- I found video [vim and tmux with c++/c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MG91ihb0oZ0) which has some interesting side-by-side use cases; largely what I do with emacs and the shell.

- in it is a recommendation to enable scrolling in tmux, from tmux.conf:

``` shell
# who knows what this does, but I can now scroll in a tmux window
set -g terminal-overrides 'xterm*:smcup@:rmcup@'
set -g mode-mouse on
```

- of course?, I don't want that if I use iterm2 to manage tmux.
