# Some Introduction-to-REST resources

I polled the api-craft@googlegroups.com list for references people have found useful
when getting started. Here are some responses:

: Books, that was useful to me:

	+ [REST in practice](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596805838.do) - good
	  book that explains many concepts of REST, including
	  resources and transitions design, http codes use, caching etc., but focus on
	  custom media formats
	+ [RESTful Web APIs](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028468.do) - more
	  fresh book.
	  It focuses on a question of formats, trying
	  to define, do we need custom format for any API or common hypermedia formats
	  are better + semantics thougts
