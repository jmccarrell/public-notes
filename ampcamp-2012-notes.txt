Here is word count in spark:

val lines = sc.textFile("hamlet.txt")

val counts = lines.flatMap(line => line.split(" "))
                  .map(word => (word, 1))
                  .reduceByKey(_ + _)

conviva's analytics machines:
reporting cluster: 4 nodes; 16 cores each; 96G of ram
xx cluster: 10 nodes; 16? cores; 200G of ram

conviva has its own internal workflow system
