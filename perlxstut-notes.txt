proteus-> perl -V:make
make='make';

the typemap file is stored in $PERLLIB/ExtUtils/typemap
this file is split into 3 parts:

1. maps various C data types to a name, which somewhat correpsonds to a perl data type.
2. contains C code called by xsubpp for input parameters
3.                                      output

----------------

In EXAMPLE 4, the link step fails for me on OS X because it invokes ar directly;
OS X uses Mach-O, which doesn't support ar. 
Instead, libtool is the desired interface.

So I need to change the recipe in one of the files to call libtool instead
of calling ar and ranlib directly.

Try:
  DONE reading the libtool manpage on OS X.
  see if I can get the linking flags out of perl -V
