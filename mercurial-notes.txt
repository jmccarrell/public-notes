Jeffs notes on mercurial

http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/UnderstandingMercurial

is a very good overview of how the distributed vcs works.

take home points include:
there is no central repository
the version tree is a graph
copies of the tree must be explicity synced together

the verbs of mercurial are:

push / pull / clone
import / export
