graceful restart

sending apache the USR1 signal will cause it to gracefully restart
as opposed to HUP
this will
  - allow any current requests to complete
  - not drop any tcp queued requests

HTTP 1.1 requires a host to be passed after the GET request, which can be used
to test virtual servers with telnet, or telnet inside the browser

GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: www.virtual1.com

and

GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: www.othervirtual.com

apache will check its configuration without starting up if given the -t flag.

can I pass the -t flag through?
service apache start -t


To build a copy from src that won't conflict with any existing copy do
something like:

./configure --prefix=/opt/apache2 --port=4444

use a port above 1024 if not building as root

read this for apache configuration:

Alternatively, the Alias directive will map any part of the filesystem into the web
space. For example, with

Alias /docs /var/web

the URL http://www.example.com/docs/dir/file.html will be served from
/var/web/dir/file.html. The ScriptAlias directive works the same way, with the additional
effect that all content located at the target path is treated as CGI scripts.
