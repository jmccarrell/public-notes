I got the current 5.8.x release
then

./Configure -DDEBUGGING -de
make

The results of a Configure run are stored in the config.sh and Policy.sh files.

make distclean removes the effects of Configure

Next I need to make uninstall work;
I think there is an UNINST define; check this
can't find it; uninstall is provided by higher level packaging (rpm)
Move on.

read mod_perl 2 users's guide section on building and installing mod_perl

Steps:

get apache compiled on jeff-dev
  static or dynamic linking?
get perl compiled on jeff-dev
get mod_perl compiled on jeff-dev

Look at rpm spec files to see what they do to the virgin sources

Right now on jeff-dev, I only have perl module SRPMs.
Go get the relevant SRPMs:

Accoring to rpm:

jeff-dev-> rpm -qif /usr/bin/perl

On jeff-dev, I have in ~/tmp:

jeff-dev-> ls *.src.rpm
httpd-2.0.52-41.ent.centos4.src.rpm  mod_perl-1.99_16-4.5.src.rpm

So I need to get to our package repository, which is behind the firewall at:

lynx http://ops.imiclk.local/centos

navigate to the directory:
4.7/os/SRPMS

There one can find the apache and mod_perl SRPMs, as well as the perl srpm.
Now I have all of the SRPMs, so I need to actually build and install them on my box
with the ability to restore things to their default values without too much trouble.

http://jons-thoughts.blogspot.com/2007/10/rpm-101-brief-tutorial-on-rpm-building.html

is a resource I found.
According to this tutorial, I have to set up my build environment.
Don't build as root.
Assume the build directory is going to be called ~/mp-leak-build

jeff-dev-> cd ~/mp-leak-build/
jeff-dev-> mkdir SRPMS RPMS SOURCES BUILD SPECS

Now tell rpm to use those directories by creating/editing ~/.rpmmacros:

jeff-dev-> cat ~/.rpmmacros
%_topdir        /home/imiuser/mp-leak-build

What is in the updates directory of our acerno yum site?
