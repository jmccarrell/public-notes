I met last night with Charles (?) and Vaughn where we discussed the problem of producing
accurate network timing in general.

Here are my notes:

The NY stock exchange is very interested in network timing, as small time deltas can
mean dollars to them in terms of when transactions get completed.
Ptpd posted by the NY stock exchange is a good place to start.
Charles helped them.

We discussed running an NTP or PTP server on a small processor,
like a freescale
in an FPGA? on the board

The linux micro kernel: 'micro C linux' may be useful
http://www.uclinux.org/

Timing is provided by an oscillator
drivers to read the interface provided by the oscillator would be required.

Oscillators have an exponential price performance curve
Picking the appropriate part of the price performnace curve will be important

There are 2 ethernet interfaces on the board: in and out
The latency through the device does not matter; however, it matters a lot
that the latency on either side of the ? is the same.
I don't understand this aspect very clearly.

A fraction of the packets processed by the device will have accurate timestamps added to them.

A major question: is how accurate do the timestamps need to be for this project to be successful?

PTP, aka IEEE 1588 is a rival timing specification to NTP.
PTP is more oriented toward layer 2, NTP is more layer 3.
