* Jeffs notes on using Salt

** Targeting nodes
There are several ways to name which nodes to affect.  As well, these can be combined using a _type_ ~@~ prefix with boolean operators.  Eg:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
salt -C 'G@os:Ubuntu and I@role:web and S@192.168.100.0/24' test.ping
#+END_SRC
Note the use of ~-C~ for Compound targeting

Here is the table of type target types and what they affect
| Prefix | Target type                   |
|--------+-------------------------------|
| G      | Grains                        |
| E      | PCRE over minion id           |
| P      | PCRE over grains              |
| L      | explicit comma separated list |
| I      | Pillar                        |
| J      | PCR over Pillar               |
| S      | Subnet / IPv4 CIDR            |
| R      | SECO range                    |

*** batch size
Additionally, one can control how many of the matched hosts are operated on at a time using ~--batch-size~, which can be an integer or a %.

Here 10 machines at a time are pinged
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
salt '*' -b 10 test.ping
#+END_SRC
and here we restart the web servers in a rolling 25% window
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
salt -G 'os:RedHat' --batch-size 25% apache.signal restart
#+END_SRC

*** Nodegroups
Alternatively, one can configure named sets of nodes in the master config file.  As an example:
#+BEGIN_SRC yaml
nodegroups:
    webdev:  'I@role:web and G:cluster:dev'
    webqa:   'I@role:web and G:cluster:qa'
    webprod: 'I@role:web and G:cluster:prod'
#+END_SRC
Then use ~-N~ to target these nodes
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
salt -N webqa test.ping
#+END_SRC
