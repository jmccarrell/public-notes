    When you connect to the database by providing your user name and password, you specify
    the schema and indicate that you are its owner. In Oracle Database, the user name and
    the name of the schema to which the user connects are the same.

About SQL*Plus sqlplus

  SQL*Plus (pronounced sequel plus) is an interactive and batch query tool that is
  installed with every Oracle Database installation. It has a command-line user interface
  that acts as the client when connecting to the database.

  SQL*Plus has its own commands and environment. In the SQL*Plus environment, you can
  enter and run SQL*Plus commands, SQL statements, PL/SQL statements, and operating system
  commands to perform tasks such as:

    - Formatting, performing calculations on, storing, and printing query results

    - Examining tables and object definitions

    - Developing and running batch scripts

    - Performing database administration

  You can use SQL*Plus to generate reports interactively, to generate reports as batch
  processes, and to output the results to text file, to screen, or to HTML file for
  browsing on the Internet. You can generate reports dynamically using the HTML output
  facility.

  You can use SQL*Plus in SQL Developer. For details, see Oracle Database SQL Developer
  User's Guide.
