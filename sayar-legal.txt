No phone call yet, so I called her.

Cynthia is trying to get more info from college board.
Get confirmation of the alternative testing with Marcus.

Sent Cynthia an email telling her Marcus has already signed up for alternnative testing.

Next step is a status update by COB today.


Form letter

The following provides more specific info:

The documentation does not support a need for 50% extended time in writing.

The documentation does not demonstrate functional limitations in learning.

Relative weaknesses in your cognitive and / or academic profile are not sufficient evidence of significant learning impairments to support the request for extended time in writing.

The documentation you provided does not support your need for a computer.

Testing data does not show a deficit in your written expression skills (writing samples 156).  

Visual motor integration problems without an impact on written expression skills are not sufficient to support the request for use of a computer.
